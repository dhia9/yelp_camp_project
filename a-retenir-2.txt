generally used moddlewares

app.use(=>)
runs code on every single request

app.use(express.static)---------->use static files
app.use(express.json()) parse the body into json 
app.use(express.urlencoded()) special url fonctions 


morgan well knowns middleware
app.use(moragen("tiny"))----->logs requests

 
res.send() in app.use() is a brake middleware 
everything stops 
to execute next middleware

app.use((req,res,next)=>{
    console.log
    next()
})
and we could do this and it would continu whilematching with directories
app.use((req,res,next)=>{
    console.log
    next()
})
app.use((req,res,next)=>{
    console.log
    next()
})
app.use((req,res,next)=>{
    console.log
    next()
})
it would execute the 3 request"middleware"
if we execute right after next()
a thing it would still run 
app.use((req,res,next)=>{
    console.log
    next()
    console.log
})
here we will have the 2nd console.log and it executes after next() finishes*

to make sure nothing happes after next()
we do return next()



---
req.method get put
req.path /products
req.query access quuery

if we define request.requestTime in a request 
than if we do next()
we have access to it in the requests after
--------
to do the error response 
we do app.use((req,res)=>{
    res.status(404).sennd("NOT found)

})

the status will be visible in the network and the console
in the fin

// authentification


app.use((req,res,next)=>{
    const {password}=req.query
    if(password===){
        next()

    }else{
        res.send("sorry you need password")

    }

    
})

one of the best methods is oingg insteas of app.use 
a functio with next and something to break it like res.send and then in an app.get for example , it takes many callbacks , we put there the function and the  function that we want to execute right after 
so instead of following same root
we can just define a function equivalent to app.use
and then put it as a callback in a request



--------------ejs engine
 
const ejsMate=require("ejs-mate");
app.ejsMate("ejs",ejsMate)
 
 must to do body     <%-body %>
 in layout file

 <% layout("layouts/boilerplate") %>
 this makes requests that the output of the ejs file be passed to the given view as body 
 it doesn t replace the body there is still this 
 <body>
    
    <h1>before</h1>
    <%-body %>
    <h1>after</h1>
</body>



modifying this <!-- <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg bg-body-tertiary"> -->
    <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-dark bg-dark"> 

    lets the navbar become dark


adding in the class sticky-top
makes it stick while scrolling


to include partials we just write in the boilerplate
<body>
<%- include("../partials/navbar")  %>
and then in directory we paste the raw html



--------bootstrap
<footer class="footer bg-dark">
    <div class="container">
    
bg dark background bg
container the format of a container
